Source Changes
--------------
-mips3: Add integer divide-by-zero handling to MIPS III cores. [MooglyGuy]

-segas32: Redumped oversized Stadium Cross ROMs at the correct sizes. [Guru]

-aica.c: ADPCM looping (DC swirl sound) and address masking (Red Dog)
 fixes [MetalliC, Wind]

-segasp.c: basic system and IO hookup - BIOS is working,
 Tetris Giant boots to title, other rom based games start loading
 but hang due missing RFID reader [MetalliC]

-atomiswave: more correct ROM board PIO access (fixes ggisuka, rumblef2
 crash) [MetalliC, CaH4e3]

-arm7: STM decrementing mode actually writes in incrementing mode on
 real h/w.  Used heavily by GBA "Classic NES" carts.
 [R. Belmont, endrift]

-Some work towards "Unknown 186 Gambling Game". Shows some menus, but
 it's nowhere near playable [Angelo Salese]

-Moved build system to GENie [Miodrag Milanovic, Vas Crabb, Couriersud]

-Added support for per-OSD mak files [qmc2]

-mips3: Made fast RAM option common to both interpreter and DRC. [MooglyGuy]

-Added proper sound comms for hng64 [Angelo Salese]

-Fix SegaPCM volume register overflow [superctr]

-netdev: fix race condition/crash when using the OSD to choose pcap
 devices. [Rob Braun]

-mtwins pal [Corrado Tomaselli]

-goldstar.c DIP/input updates [Bad A. Billy]

-More iteagle improvements: [Ted Green]
 * PCI: allow BAR of 0; change "invalid" from 0 to -1
 * vrc4373: implement bus-master DMA
 * es1373: Do some processing and DMA, and issue IRQs

-z80pio: Added individual write line handlers for port bits.
 [Curt Coder]

-Fix yuv texture conversion for opengl [O. Galibert]

-Native CoreAudio sound output for OSX [Vas Crabb]
 * Audibly lower latency than SDL sound output
 * Allows selection of output device (-audio_output)
 * Allows up to ten AudioUnit effects (-audio_effect0..9)
 * New aueffectuitl tool to create/edit effects
 * Also supports standard .aupreset effect files

-6522via: Added device address map. [Curt Coder]

-mos6530: Rewritten to support time travel. [Curt Coder]

-Allow font face/size selection for Qt and Cocoa debuggers [Vas Crabb]

-hexion.c: Document chip locations and xtal based on PCB pictures of
 Konami PCB and bootleg PCB [Lord Nightmare]

-Tidy MAME source files [Zoe Blade]

-Replace simple_set with std::set [Vas Crabb]

-Add the ability to mcs51 family processors to use port bits as inputs
 which actually are used as outputs because a "0" has been written to
 them. The CMOS chips in the family may be misused in this way when a
 low impedance source is connected to them. [Couriersud]

-Fixed cardline driver. [Couriersud]

-Hooked up 6845 to cardline. [Couriersud]

-sigmab98.c: fixed position of zoomed sprites and added sprite RAM

-Improve truthtable handling in netlist. Prepare per-game setting of
 USE_DEACTIVE_DEVICE. [Couriersud]

-Add 9312/DM9312 to netlist. [Couriersud]

-Fix repetitive monitor updates. By design, MAME has an issue setting
 aspect correctly on monitor resolution changes. This needs to be
 addressed separately. [Couriersud]

-Added 74192, 9316, 9310 and 74193 devices to netlist. Added breakout
 (wip) netlist as well, but still have to implement three more devices
 until work can really start. [Couriersud]

-luaengine improvements [Luca Bruno]

-Jump Bug (galaxian.c): Adjusted clock speed to have working audio
 match that of video from PCB.  Added notes regarding missing audio and
 flagged game  [Tafoid]

 [Couriersud]

-berzerk.c: Verified and corrected the rom labels for Berzerk (set 1)
 [Brian Troha]

-Some WIP for Cirrus Logic GD542x/3x video chipsets, and split from 
 pc_vga.c into it's own file.  Hardware cursor is working, but other 
 acceleration features still need a lot of work. [Barry Rodewald]

-*nix man pages: Added new options to select debugger font face and
 size [Cesare Falco]

-SDLMAME v0.160 selects the first mode unconditionally as a best mode
 when -switchres is used on SDL12 [KO Myung-Hun]
